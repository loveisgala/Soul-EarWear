# Soul-Earwear

## General info
This project is based on an exercise from https://www.freecodecamp.org/ 'Responsive Web Design Certification' section. <br>
The thematic is a 'landing-page' and its about earrings!. <br>
It contains some additional id's to follow the test guidelines. <br>
I made a design with soft shades of pink, fonts from 'Google Fonts' and a Logo created in Adobe Photoshop. <br>
The order of the elements was made with Flexbox for mobile-view and Grid for web-view.
